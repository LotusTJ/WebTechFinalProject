Project Description : Meal-Maker is a recipe-finder that will allow users to retrieve a unique selection of
food recipes based on input from the user, providing a quick and convenient way to
discover meals that fit their current situation. Imagine the scenario where one comes
home after a long day at work/school, and wants to make a meal with whatever they
have lying around in the kitchen, relying on the app to match available ingredients to
possible dishes.
The user can filter through the recipes via ingredients, country of origin,
categorizations of savory and sweet, estimated calories, and estimated budget,
enabling a more personalized and health- or cost-conscious search experience.

Users can also upload recipes that other users can rate, this can affect scores of savory
and sweet and estimated budget, allowing the app's recipe rankings and classifications
to evolve based on community feedback.
